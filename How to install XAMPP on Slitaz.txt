It might be a permission problem. You need to be root to untar something in /opt

Do you want Bash for /bin/sh (yes/No) ? :

//Quick tip for people who want to use XAMPP for Linux on Slitaz

A tip for those who want to install XAMPP for Linux on Slitaz - I'm using 1.7.1 as it has PHP 5.2.x (which I need for some apps) - slitaz has its own httpd running on port 82, which results in XAMPP not starting Apache saying that another web server is already running.

So to start XAMPP for Linux you will have to kill that background process:

$ ps aux | grep httpd

1765 httpd ...
2736 httpd ...
283  grep httpd

$ kill -9 1765 2736

Then you can start XAMPP and it won't complain that "Another web server is already running"

Now, if you need the TazPanel running again, it wont start by merely clicking on the menu item.
You have to enter the following command (because you kill'ed it)
$ httpd -p 82 -u root -c /etc/slitaz/httpd.conf -r TazPanel Authentication - Default: root:root

Both commands above need to be run as root

If you want to use "sudo", you have to install sudo from TazPanel
and then add your username to the /etc/sudoers file like this:
username ALL=(ALL) ALL
just below
root ALL=(ALL) ALL

If you dont have or dont want to use sudo, you simply have to type "su" and then the root password that you gave during install, and then, you become root.
Then you enter the commands and they work.

Hope that helps,

Busybox httpd listening on port 80 is stopping XAMPP apache from starting.
# /etc/init.d/httpd stop
Tazpanel which runs on busybox httpd port 82 is not the issue.
Busybox httpd running on port 80 can be stopped from auto-starting on boot by editing /etc/rcS.conf, remove httpd from RUN_DAEMONS=
The reason httpd on port 80 is auto-started is so Applications/Development/CGI SHell Environment, tazwiki and other default installed programs requiring a web server work.
http://localhost/cgi-bin/cgi-env.sh

To restart tazpanel if you choose to kill all instances of httpd:
# tazpanel start

Thanks for the prompt clarification. I was wondering why port 82 being specified was still blocking XAMPP's Apache on port 80. Now it is clarified.

Thanks,
sleekaz.
